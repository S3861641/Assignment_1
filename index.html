						<h1>About me</h1>

						<p>I was born in Sydney, Australia to Portuguese parents and as such I grew it was important for my parents for me to learn to speak Portuguese, therefore I am fully bilingual in both languages, although reading and writing of Portuguese takes a lot more effort to comprehend.</p>

						<p>Through my European heritage I have come to appreciate architecture that depicts a time, originality, uses elements of nature, and can identify a country or even city / region of origin.  I cannot say I appreciate modern architecture.  It makes me feel personally like we lack originality.  E.g. I admire how artwork on ceilings in Europe, how they have stood the test of time, and I am amazed at how the artist could do such work without having constant pain in the neck!</p>

						<p><strong><em><u>The Type Finder Personality</strong></em></u></p>
					
						<p>The 3 main types of personalities drawn from this test were:</p>
						
						<p><strong><em>The healer</strong></em> – here I would be looking at new ways of doing things, open to new ideas, things that I believe in and I feel benefit the those who need it most within the constraints of resources available.</p>						
						
						<p><strong><em>The Architect</strong></em> – like the healer, while attempting to look at things in a deeper, logical and systematic manner.</p>
						
						<p><strong><em>The Counsellor</strong></em> – I often look within myself to see where I can improve as a person and am happy listen to peoples hopes and dreams an encourage people in that direction.</p>
						
						<p>I am also an introvert, try to follow my gut instincts and try not to judge.</p>

						<p><strong><em><u>Personality Max Report</strong></em></u></p>
						
						<p>Here I found the following results to be true:</p>

						<p>It can take me a while to digest written content, as opposed to being show and practising something, (although be it trial and error).  I learn best from my mistakes.</p>
						
						<p>I also like to listen and participate in debates, (more often I am learning than my listening more than participation).</p>

						<p>Too much commotion in terms of everyone screaming over one another, causes a blockage in my head where I turn off, because I cannot focus on all the sounds at once.</p>

						<p>Many times, people describe things and I visualise each of the description.  I often ask questions if something does not make sense.</p>
							
						<p>Charts, graphs are most useful when dealing with data as opposed too many facts and figures.</p>

						<p><strong><em><u>Creativity Quiz</strong></em></u></p>
									
						<p>I am not overly creative most of the time, but I do like to investigate things more deeply and understand the why or why nots.</p>
