						<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

						<p>My interest in IT has been long standing since, my generation was the first to have them in schools, although there was a limited amount of computers supplier to the school.  This meant that most students missed out.  The concept that words could be typed on a screen as opposed to a typewriter and then printed on to paper via wires connected to a printer, isn’t that contraption something we go to specialists for?  That was the late 1980s!  Oh, my how things have change in the past few decades.  We didn’t even have a phone until we moved residences after nearly 20 years!  What can I say dad was tight with money?</p>
					
						<p>Moving on the current decade I my interest in IT remains, although the capabilities and what captures the imagine, well it is unimaginable.  The thing that most intrigues me most is how everything comes together, all the IT professionals collaborating to get to the product or service.  It is absolutely astounding.</p>
				
						<p>As for why I chose RMIT, well they appeared to have very good reputation in terms of IT.  Ultimately, I would like to assist investigators in finding leads, to assist with investigations.  I figured if I could understand the ins and outs of varying process this would enhance my skills and hone in on the processes that would likely provide better outcomes.</p>
